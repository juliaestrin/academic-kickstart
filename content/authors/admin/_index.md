My name is Julia and I am an undergradute at Northeastern University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My passion for engineering is two fold - the thrill of analytical problem solving and the potential to propel the sustainable development agenda. Through this website, I plan to share the projects I have worked on as well as a little about my personal life.
